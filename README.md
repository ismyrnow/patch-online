__online file patching utility in node.js__

This code provides a web interface for patching files. You upload the file, and the patch, and it returns the patched file.

It's a decent node example, but needs some love.

I probably won't continue to develop this, since nodester won't allow the ability to execute the patch command. Totally understandable, too.
